Hello people!
In my React Ecom site, I used context API for functionality such as delete, add and increase/decrease. The site is made with React.Js, and is mobile friendly.
What makes the project a ecom site is that I installed an NPM package called Paypal-Sandbox. 
Paypal-Sandbox is a dummy payment systems but acts as a real one. I highly recommend this package!
